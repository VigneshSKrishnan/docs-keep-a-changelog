# Video Optimization

Websites with video lead to higher engagement and sales. But videos files are big and it is important that you deliver the video properly and ensure that the playback of the video is seamless and doesn't stall. When a smaller video is downloaded, video playback occurs sooner, and the video buffer fills up faster.

ImageKit.io offers multiple video optimization features that work out of the box. For example, automatic best format selection and quality optimization reduce the final size of the output video.

Automatic format conversion is turned ON by default, in line with the standard practices for delivering videos on the web.

Automatic video format selection and AV1 video codec output are enabled by default for new signups as of October 17, 2023. You can change the automatic video format, allowed output video codecs and quality optimization settings for your account under [video settings](https://imagekit.io/dashboard?redirectTo=settings-videos-optimization) in your dashboard.
